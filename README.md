<h1 align="center">NestJS + React Full-Stack Starter</h1>

<p align="center">
  A robust starter repository for building modern, full-stack web applications. It combines a powerful <a href="http://nestjs.com/" target="_blank">NestJS</a> backend with a dynamic <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a> frontend, both written in TypeScript.
</p>

## Latest Update

- Added new dependencies: `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/modifiers`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `socket.io-client`, and `uuid` in the client.
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for both client and server to include `@nestjs/platform-socket.io` and `@nestjs/websockets`.
- Implemented new routes for login, signup, and kanban board in the client application.
- **Added Kanban board functionality to the client application:**
  - The Kanban board provides a visual project management tool with multiple columns (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
  - Users can add new columns to represent different stages or categories in their workflow.
  - Tasks (tiles) can be created and assigned to any column, representing individual work items or project tasks.
  - Tasks can be dragged and dropped between columns to update their status or progress.
  - The board is designed to help teams and individuals organize, prioritize, and track project tasks efficiently.
- Introduced `TaskPriority` enum in the server for task management.

## Description

This starter project provides a solid foundation for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable applications. It's pre-configured with a monorepo structure to manage both the server and client code in a single repository.

## Key Features

**Backend (NestJS)**

- âœ… **Modern & Scalable:** Built with the progressive Node.js framework, NestJS.
- âœ… **TypeScript First:** Strong typing for robust and maintainable code.
- âœ… **Modular Architecture:** Organized into modules for clear separation of concerns.
- âœ… **Authentication & Authorization:** Pre-configured with JWT-based authentication.
- âœ… **Database Integration:** Ready-to-use setup with TypeORM and PostgreSQL.
- âœ… **Configuration Management:** Centralized and environment-aware configuration.
- âœ… **Validation:** Built-in validation pipes for incoming requests.
- âœ… **API Documentation:** Automatic API documentation generation with Swagger (OpenAPI).

**Frontend (React)**

- âœ… **Component-Based UI:** Powered by the popular React library.
- âœ… **TypeScript Support:** Type safety for your frontend components and logic.
- âœ… **Development Server:** Hot-reloading for a smooth development experience.
- âœ… **API Proxy:** Pre-configured to proxy API requests to the NestJS backend, avoiding CORS issues in development.

## Roadmap

We are continuously working to improve this starter repository. Here are some of the features we plan to add:

**Frontend:**
- ðŸš€ **Kanban Boards:** A feature-rich, interactive Kanban board for task management.
- ðŸš€ **Real-time Collaboration:** WebSocket integration for live collaboration features.
- ðŸš€ **MDX Editor:** A powerful Markdown editor with component support for creating rich content.

**Backend & DevOps:**
- ðŸš€ **Redis Caching:** Integration with Redis for high-performance caching.
- ðŸš€ **Nginx Integration:** Configuration for using Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer in production.

## Advanced Project Management Features (Planned)

We are considering the following advanced features for future integration to enhance project management capabilities:

- **Task Assignment & User Roles:** Assign tasks to users/teams and define roles with permissions.
- **Due Dates & Reminders:** Add due dates to tasks and send automated reminders.
- **Task Dependencies:** Set and visualize dependencies between tasks.
- **Subtasks & Checklists:** Break down tasks into subtasks or checklists.
- **Labels, Tags, & Priorities:** Categorize and prioritize tasks with labels and tags.
- **Comments & Activity Feed:** Enable discussions and maintain an activity log for tasks.
- **File Attachments:** Attach files and documents to tasks.
- **Time Tracking & Estimates:** Log time spent and add time estimates for tasks.
- **Customizable Workflows:** Create custom columns, workflows, and templates.
- **Notifications & Real-Time Collaboration:** In-app/email notifications and live updates.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Visualize progress with charts and export reports.
- **Calendar & Timeline Views:** Integrate calendar and Gantt/timeline views for planning.
- **Integration with External Tools:** Connect with Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Jira, etc.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Search and filter tasks by various criteria.
- **Project Archiving & Templates:** Archive projects and reuse templates for workflows.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with two main packages:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/      # React frontend application
â”œâ”€â”€ server/      # NestJS backend application
â””â”€â”€ package.json # Root package.json for shared scripts
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MortadhaHouch/nestJS_starter.git
   cd nestJS_starter
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   This command will install dependencies for both the `server` and `client` applications.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - **Backend:** Navigate to the `server` directory, copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file, and update the variables as needed.
     ```bash
     cd server
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - **Frontend:** The React app can use environment variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_`. Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory if needed.

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Run both client and server concurrently for development
$ npm run dev

# Run only the backend server (in watch mode)
$ npm run start:dev:server

# Run only the frontend client
$ npm run start:dev:client

# Build both client and server for production
$ npm run build

# Run the production-ready server (after building)
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
